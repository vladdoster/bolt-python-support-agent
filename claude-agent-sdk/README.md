# Casey: IT Support Agent (Bolt for Python and Claude Agent SDK)

Meet Casey (it/this/that) — an AI-powered IT support agent that lives in Slack. Casey can troubleshoot common issues, search knowledge base articles, reset passwords, check system status, and create support tickets, all without leaving the conversation.

Built with [Bolt for Python](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/bolt-python/) and the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) using models from [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com).

## App Overview

Casey gives your team instant IT support through four entry points:

* **App Home** — Users open Casey's Home tab and choose from common issue categories (Password Reset, Access Request, Software Help, Network Issues, Something Else). A modal collects details, then Casey starts a DM thread with a resolution.
* **Direct Messages** — Users message Casey directly to describe any IT issue. Casey responds in-thread, maintaining context across follow-ups.
* **Channel @mentions** — Users mention `@Casey` in any channel to get help without leaving the conversation.
* **Assistant Panel** — Users click _Add Agent_ in Slack, select Casey, and pick from suggested prompts or describe an issue.

Casey uses five simulated tools to assist users:

* **Knowledge Base Search** — Finds relevant articles for common topics like VPN, email, Wi-Fi, printers, and more.
* **Support Ticket Creation** — Creates a tracked ticket when issues need human follow-up.
* **Password Reset** — Triggers a password reset and confirms the action.
* **System Status Check** — Reports the operational status of company systems.
* **User Permissions Lookup** — Shows access levels and group memberships.

> **Note:** All tools return simulated data for demonstration purposes. In a production app, these would connect to your actual IT systems.

### Slack MCP Server

Casey also works with the [Slack MCP Server](https://docs.slack.dev/ai/slack-mcp-server), giving it the ability to search messages and files, read channel history and threads, send messages, schedule messages, and create or update Slack canvases. When deployed with OAuth (HTTP mode), Casey automatically connects to the Slack MCP Server using the user's token, unlocking these capabilities on top of the built-in IT tools.

## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you have permissions to install apps.

### Developer Program

Join the [Slack Developer Program](https://api.slack.com/developer-program) for exclusive access to sandbox environments for building and testing your apps, tooling, and resources created to help you build and grow.

### Create the Slack app

<details><summary><strong>Using Slack CLI</strong></summary>

Install the latest version of the Slack CLI for your operating system:

- [Slack CLI for macOS & Linux](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-mac-and-linux/)
- [Slack CLI for Windows](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-windows/)

You'll also need to log in if this is your first time using the Slack CLI.

```sh
slack login
```

#### Initializing the project

```sh
slack create my-casey-agent --template slack-samples/bolt-python-support-agent --subdir claude-agent-sdk
cd my-casey-agent
```

## Development

### Starting the app

<details><summary><strong>Using the Slack CLI</strong></summary>

#### Slack CLI

```sh
slack run
```
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Using the Terminal</strong></summary>

#### Terminal

```sh
python3 app.py
```

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Using OAuth HTTP Server (with ngrok)</strong></summary>

#### OAuth HTTP Server

This mode uses an HTTP server instead of Socket Mode, which is required for OAuth-based distribution.

1. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and start a tunnel:

```sh
ngrok http 3000
```

2. Copy the `https://*.ngrok-free.app` URL from the ngrok output.

<details><summary><strong>Using Slack CLI</strong></summary>

#### Slack CLI

3. Update `manifest.json` for HTTP mode:
   - Set `socket_mode_enabled` to `false`
   - Replace `ngrok-free.app` with your ngrok domain (e.g. `YOUR_NGROK_SUBDOMAIN.ngrok-free.app`)

4. Create a new local dev app:

```sh
slack install -E local
```

5. _(Slack CLI < v4.1.0 only)_ Enable MCP for your app:
   - Run `slack app settings` to open your app's settings
   - Navigate to **Agents & AI Apps** in the left-side navigation
   - Toggle **Model Context Protocol** on

6. Update your `.env` OAuth environment variables:
   - Run `slack app settings` to open App Settings
   - Copy **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Signing Secret**
   - Update `SLACK_REDIRECT_URI` in `.env` with your ngrok domain

```sh
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=YOUR_SIGNING_SECRET
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=https://YOUR_NGROK_SUBDOMAIN.ngrok-free.app/slack/oauth_redirect
```

7. Start the app:

```sh
slack run app_oauth.py
```

8. Click the install URL printed in the terminal to install the app to your workspace via OAuth.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Using the Terminal</strong></summary>

#### Terminal

3. Create your Slack app at [api.slack.com/apps/new](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) using [`manifest.json`](./manifest.json). Before pasting the manifest, set `socket_mode_enabled` to `false` and replace `ngrok-free.app` with your ngrok domain.

4. Install the app to your workspace and copy the following values into your `.env`:
   - **Signing Secret** — from _Basic Information_
   - **Bot User OAuth Token** — from _OAuth & Permissions_
   - **Client ID** and **Client Secret** — from _Basic Information_

```sh
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=YOUR_SIGNING_SECRET
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=https://YOUR_NGROK_SUBDOMAIN.ngrok-free.app/slack/oauth_redirect
```

Replace `your-subdomain` in `SLACK_REDIRECT_URI` with your ngrok subdomain.

5. Start the app:

```sh
python3 app_oauth.py
```

6. Click the install URL printed in the terminal to install the app to your workspace via OAuth.

</details>

> **Note:** Each time ngrok restarts, it generates a new URL. You'll need to update the ngrok domain in `manifest.json`, `SLACK_REDIRECT_URI` in your `.env`, and re-install the app.

</details>

### Using the App

Once Casey is running, there are several ways to interact:

**App Home** — Open Casey in Slack and click the _Home_ tab. You'll see five category buttons. Click one to open a modal, describe your issue, and submit. Casey will start a DM thread with you containing a diagnosis and next steps.

**Direct Messages** — Open a DM with Casey. You'll see suggested prompts like _Reset Password_, _Request Access_, and _Network Issues_ — pick one or describe your own issue. Casey will react with :eyes: while processing, then reply in a thread. Send follow-up messages in the same thread and Casey will maintain the full conversation context.

**Channel @mentions** — Invite Casey to a channel by typing `/invite @Casey` in the message box, then type `@Casey` followed by your issue. Casey responds in a thread so the channel stays clean.

**Assistant Panel** — Click _Add Agent_ in the top-right corner of Slack, select Casey from the list, then pick a suggested prompt or type a message.

Casey will add a :white_check_mark: reaction when it believes an issue has been resolved, and occasionally adds a contextual emoji reaction to keep things friendly.

### Linting

```sh
# Run ruff check from root directory for linting
ruff check

# Run ruff format from root directory for code formatting
ruff format
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.json`

`manifest.json` is a configuration for Slack apps. With a manifest, you can create an app with a pre-defined configuration, or adjust the configuration of an existing app.

### `app.py`

`app.py` is the entry point for the application and is the file you'll run to start the server. This project uses `AsyncApp` from Bolt for Python, with all handlers running asynchronously.

### `app_oauth.py`

`app_oauth.py` is an alternative entry point that runs the app in HTTP mode instead of Socket Mode. This is intended for deployments that use OAuth for app distribution. See the HTTP Mode section under Development for setup instructions.

### `manifest_oauth.json`

`manifest_oauth.json` is the app manifest configured for HTTP mode (Socket Mode disabled, with request URLs for event subscriptions and interactivity). Use this when setting up the app for HTTP mode instead of `manifest.json`.

### `/listeners`

Every incoming request is routed to a "listener". This directory groups each listener based on the Slack Platform feature used.

**`/listeners/events`** — Handles incoming events:

- `app_home_opened.py` — Publishes the App Home view with category buttons.
- `app_mentioned.py` — Responds to `@Casey` mentions in channels.
- `message.py` — Responds to direct messages from users.

**`/listeners/actions`** — Handles interactive components:

- `category_buttons.py` — Opens the issue submission modal when a category button is clicked.
- `feedback.py` — Handles thumbs up/down feedback on Casey's responses.

**`/listeners/views`** — Handles view submissions and builds Block Kit views:

- `issue_modal.py` — Processes modal submissions, starts a DM thread, and runs the agent.
- `app_home_builder.py` — Constructs the App Home Block Kit view.
- `modal_builder.py` — Constructs the issue submission modal.
- `feedback_block.py` — Creates the feedback button block attached to responses.

### `/agent`

The `casey.py` file configures the Claude Agent SDK with a system prompt, tools registered via an MCP server, and a `run_casey_agent()` async function that handles sending queries and collecting responses.

The `deps.py` file defines the `CaseyDeps` dataclass passed to the agent at runtime, providing access to the Slack client and conversation context.

The `tools` directory contains five IT support tools defined using the `@tool` decorator from the Claude Agent SDK.

### `/thread_context`

The `store.py` file implements a thread-safe in-memory session ID store, keyed by channel and thread. The Claude Agent SDK manages conversation history server-side via sessions, so only session IDs need to be tracked locally for resuming conversations.

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server connection error: `HTTP error 400 (Bad Request)`

If you see an error like:

```
Failed to connect to MCP server 'streamable_http: https://mcp.slack.com/mcp': HTTP error 400 (Bad Request)
```

This means the Slack MCP feature has not been enabled for your app. There is no manifest property for this yet, so it must be toggled on manually:

1. Run `slack app settings` to open your app's settings page (or visit [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select your app)
2. Navigate to **Agents & AI Apps** in the left-side navigation
3. Toggle **Slack Model Context Protocol** on
