# Casey: IT Support Agent

Meet Casey (it/this/that) — an AI-powered IT support agent that lives in Slack. Casey can troubleshoot common issues, search knowledge base articles, reset passwords, check system status, and create support tickets, all without leaving the conversation.

Built with [Bolt for Python](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/bolt-python/).

## Choose Your Framework

This repo contains the same app built with three different AI agent frameworks. Pick the one that fits your stack:

| App | Directory | Get Started | Framework |
|-----|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Claude Agent SDK** | `claude-agent-sdk/` | [View README](./claude-agent-sdk/README.md) | [claude-agent-sdk](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) |
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | `openai-agents-sdk/` | [View README](./openai-agents-sdk/README.md) | [openai-agents](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) |
| **Pydantic AI** | `pydantic-ai/` | [View README](./pydantic-ai/README.md) | [pydantic-ai](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) |

All implementations share the same Slack listener layer, the same five simulated IT tools, and the same user experience. The only difference is how the agent is defined and executed under the hood.

## What Casey Can Do

Casey gives your team instant IT support through four entry points:

* **App Home** — Choose from common issue categories. A modal collects details, then Casey starts a DM thread with a resolution.
* **Direct Messages** — Describe any IT issue and Casey responds in-thread, maintaining context across follow-ups.
* **Channel @mentions** — Mention `@Casey` in any channel to get help without leaving the conversation.
* **Assistant Panel** — Users click _Add Agent_ in Slack, select Casey, and pick from suggested prompts or describe an issue.

Behind the scenes, Casey has access to five simulated tools: knowledge base search, support ticket creation, password reset, system status checks, and user permissions lookup.

> **Note:** All tools return simulated data for demonstration purposes. In a production app, these would connect to your actual IT systems.

### Slack MCP Server

Casey also works with the [Slack MCP Server](https://docs.slack.dev/ai/slack-mcp-server), giving it the ability to search messages and files, read channel history and threads, send messages, schedule messages, and create or update Slack canvases. When deployed with OAuth (HTTP mode), Casey automatically connects to the Slack MCP Server using the user's token, unlocking these capabilities on top of the built-in IT tools.

## Using the App

Once Casey is running, there are several ways to interact:

* **App Home** — Open Casey in Slack and click the _Home_ tab. Choose from common issue categories, describe your issue in the modal, and Casey starts a DM thread with a resolution.
* **Direct Messages** — Open a DM with Casey. Pick a suggested prompt or describe your issue, and Casey will reply in a thread.
* **Channel @mentions** — Invite Casey to a channel by typing `/invite @Casey`, then type `@Casey` followed by your issue. Casey responds in a thread so the channel stays clean.
* **Assistant Panel** — Click _Add Agent_ in the top-right corner of Slack, select Casey, and choose a suggested prompt like _Reset Password_, _Request Access_, or _Network Issues_.

For full setup instructions, pick a framework above and follow the README in that directory.
